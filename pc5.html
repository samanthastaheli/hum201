            <h2>Oedipus Rex, how one's actions affect one's future.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The story of Oedipus Rex is about how a man, Oedipus, choices have led him to his situation. His situation was predicted by an Oracle. The prediction was very unimaginable to Oedipus, so he disregarded the prediction. The prediction was that he would kill his father and marry his mother. This prediction came true due to his hubris. His hubris is shown when he becomes hot headed when he gets hit on the road and kills the man. The man was actually his father. He then goes to Thebes and kills a sphinx. The people are impressed with him and just lost their king, so they made him king. However, the former king was his father resulting in him marrying his mother. This could have been avoided if he didn’t kill his father out of rage.</p>
            <p>In my life I have never had any hubris, or rather any significant hubris that I can remember. I have avoided this by thinking my decisions through. Thinking decisions through means to account for how the action will affect other people and the future. If you think about how your actions will affect others and you have no desire to hurt people you will make a decision that will not be prideful and greedy.</p>
            <p>If Oedipus thought his actions through, he would have known that killing someone would affect his future in a negative way. For example, when Odysseus killed all of the suitors the negative affect was that the families of the suitors were angry came back to kill Odysseus. In Oedipus’s case, the negative affect was that he married his mother.</p>
