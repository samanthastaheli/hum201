            <h2>Philosophies of Virtue</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Aristotle believed that virtue was about one’s character and not a set of rules. If someone is a good person, then they will make good decisions. They don’t need rules to follow, just their good character and judgment. Aristotle also said that one can have too much virtue. He described it as a spectrum. On one side of the spectrum there was deficiency. This means having too little virtue. On the other end there was excess. This means having too much virtue. In the middle was the right amount of virtue, which Aristotle referred to as the golden mean.</p>
            <p>In my life I have sometimes been too kind. I could not stand up for myself when I needed to. This caused me to be in bad relationships with people. I had a friend that was controlling, and I could not stand up for myself. I also had a boyfriend who was unkind and manipulative. I did not want to hurt anyone’s feelings, so I did nothing to help myself.</p>
            <p>My kindness in Aristotle virtue spectrum would fall into the excess side because I had too much. The other side would be to be selfish and unkind. The golden mean would be to be kind to others while still looking out for yourself. It would be a balance of kindness and self-interest. Aristotle’s view on virtue has made me have a new perspective of being a good person. The virtue spectrum can be good to think about when making decisions.</p>
