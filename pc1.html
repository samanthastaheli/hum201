            <h2>The Enuma Elish, the myth the Babloni</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Enuma Elish tells the story of the Babylonians creation and gods. Two gods in the story named Ea and Quingu have a conflict of interest. Ea is the god of water and has devine desires. On the other hand Quingu is a god created by Timet to destroy the other gods. After Marduk, who is the god of thunderstorms, defeats Timet, Quingu is captured and brought to Ea. The gods tell him,  "Quingu is the one who instigated warfare, who made Timet rebel and set battle in motion" (Enuma Elish, Tablet VI, lines 29-30). Quingu is then punished by having his blood vessels cut off. Ea then takes Quingus blood to create humans.</p>
            <p>I am not perfect. I have faults and good things about me. I was created by Jesus Christ. One of my faults you could say is my anxiety. It can cause problem in my life in school, relationships, friends, etc. Sometimes it can block me from seeing the good things in life. It can make it hard to be motivated to read my scriptures and pray.</p>
            <p>According to the Enuma Elish, humans were  created from evil and made by a divine creator. This relates to my life because we are all created by Jesus Christ, who is a divine creator.  We also have faults, which relates to the evil of Quingu. My fault is not evil, but it is not divine.</p>
