            <h2>The Egyptain legend of Horus and the importance of his eye.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Horus was a god and king in Ancient Egypt. His parents are Osiris and Isis. His father, Osiris, was killed and split into pieces by his brother Seth. He then scattered Osiris’s pieces all over Egypt. Osiris’s wife, Isis, collected all the pieces of Osiris and her sister put him back together. Osiris became god of the underworld. Isis gave birth to Horus. Isis and Horus hid from Seth until Horus was ready to fight him. Horus’s destiny was to defeat his uncle, Seth. During their battle Horus eye got injured. Horus gave his eye to his father. This made his vison stonger because he now had an eye in the past and one in the future. Horus was also depicted as a falcon because falcons and eagles have very good vison. Horus’s vison was to unite upper and lower Egypt. In Mesopotamia they have a god named Marduk. He too defeated a someone who was oppressing to their country, Timat. He also became King afterwards. Like Horus, Marduk’s had something to aid him in his vison. This was the Tablets of Destiny, which symbolizes the ruling of the gods and controlling of fate. They had prophesies of the future on them. Marduk’s vison was that the gods will take care of the humans and in turn the humans will provide for them. This united the gods and humans. The Tablets of Destiny aided him because if gave him power and vison into the future. Marduk and Horus are different in the way that Marduk was not born a god or had a right to be King like Horus had.   </p>
            <p>Right now in my life, I am focusing on being a good friend, making new friends, learning a lot about programming and designing, going on dates, and being healthy.  In my future I want to be married and work for a web design company. To get there I will study hard and go on dates. What makes me happy in my life is having good friends, my dog, staying healthy, being productive, and being creative. Right now I have good friends that I hope to stay close with for a long time. I also eat healthy and exercise regularly.</p>
            <p>My future is not similar to Horus or Marduks’s in the way that I will not be powerful, defeat anyone, or unite people. Our battles that we face in life are not similar. Marduk and Horus battle for power and unity. In my life I battle my anxiety and OCD. I am similar to Marduk in the way that I need to work hard for what I want in the future.</p>
