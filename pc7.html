            <h2>Eudaimonia, a way of life.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p id="pc7FristP">In the ancient Greek culture, the word eudaimonia was used to describe happiness in one’s life. Eu means well and daimonian means life, so the word eudaimonia means well life. To live a well life, one must strive to do good and continue to improve oneself. Socrates philosophy is, “the unexamined life is not worth living.” To Socrates eudemonia is achieved when one seeks new knowledge and uses reason. Socrates student, Plato, believed that eudaimonia is achieved when one obtains the ideal. Plato’s ideal is having knowledge about the things around you. Aristotle’s idea of eudemonia is the golden mean. The golden mean is when someone has the right amount of a characteristic or reason. For example, one can be deficient in kindness, and have too much kindness. Augustine’s philosophy was, there is two cities, the city of God and the city of man. In the city of God, power and justice are balances and God is dominant. In the city of man, men seek to gain as much power possible, making the balance of power and justice unequal. Augustine believed eudaimonia is achieved in the City of God. The philosopher, Thomas Aquinas believed that one must use faith and reason together in order to make good decisions. All the philosophers previously mentioned have one thing in common, using knowledge and reason is important. Continually gaining knowledge is part of eudaimonia in the way that obtaining knowledge is a form improvement.</p>
            <p>	In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, one achieves Eudaimonia by loving God. This means keeping His commandments, serving His children, attend church, and study the scriptures.</p>
            <p>	The ways the church fulfills eudaimonia is similar to the way philosophers fulfill eudaimonia. Philosophers believe there is a right and wrong way to do things. In the church the commandments are the right way to do things. Philosophers also believe, the continuation of learning is an important part of life. Studying the scriptures is one way members of the church continue to learn. By reading the scriptures regularly one can feel the spirit and receive revelation. Doing so helps one obtain eudaimonia.</p>
