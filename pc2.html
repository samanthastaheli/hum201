            <h2>The Epic of Gilgamesh, how Gilgamesh became a good ruler.</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p id="pc2FristP">The Epic of Gilgamesh is a story about Gilgamesh's development as a king and a person. Gilgamesh and Enkiduâ€™s friendship is the main cause of that development. This friendship balances out Gilgamesh's overbearing power he has on his kingdom because Enkidu is just as strong as Gilgamesh. In the story, Gilgamesh and Enkidu go on a quest where they kill Humbaba. After they complete their quest, a princess named Ishtar approaches Gilgamesh and tells him to marry her. Gilgamesh refuses to marry her. This causes her to become angry and send the bull of heaven to kill him. Gilgamesh and Enkidu defeat the bull and Enkidu throws a piece of the bull at Ishta. The gods kill Enkidu as punishment for killing Humbaba and the bull of heaven. Enkidu's death starts the process of Gilgamesh's development into a better king. Enkidu brought out the part of Gilgamesh that was power hungry. After Enkidu dies Gilgamesh tries to get Enkidu back and become immortal. Gilgamesh does not accomplish this and that helps him to realize that he is not as strong has he thought and that he is mortal. This puts a stop to him abusing his power and being power hungry.</p>            
            <p>In middle school I became best friends with a girl who was popular, insecure, and not friendly. This led me to become popular, insecure, and not friendly. She was also manipulative towards me and made me feel bad about myself. My sister told her that she was manipulative and mean. This led her to become upset and our friendship to end. After that friendship ended, I became more secure with myself and have chosen to be friends with people that are friendly, kind, and supportive.</p>
            <p>My friendship in middle school and Gilgamesh and Enkidu's friendship are similar. They both brought out bad characteristics and habits, and the ending of these friendships causes growth. After Gilgamesh and Enkidu's friendship, Gilgamesh made better decisions as a king. After my friendship I made better decisions in choosing friends. Since that friendship I have learned to be around people that are kind, friendly, and supportive. Now the friends I have are good for me and do not bring out bad characteristics and habits.</p>
