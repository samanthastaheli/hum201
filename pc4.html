            <p id="pc4firstp">In book 12 of the Odyssey, Odysseus and his men travel to the island of the sun. There are cattle on this island, which Odysseus instructs his men not to eat. The cattle belonged to the sun god, Helios. However, they were on the island for a month and ran out of food. When Odysseus was asleep, his men ate some of the cattle. This made the sun god, Helios, very angry. He asks Zeus to punish them for eating his cattle. Zeus punishes them by creating a storm that wreaks their boat. The storm kills all of Odysseus men. Odysseus survives by floating on part of the ship wreckage to Calypso’s island.</p>
            <p>The commandments from Heavenly Father are guidance for our lives. These commandments keep us safe and happy. Although, breaking them may seem desirable and necessary at times. The consequences for breaking the commandments is being miserable, unsafe, and not having the Holy Ghost with you.</p>
            <p>The story of Odysseus and the sun god’s cattle can be compared to commandments that Heavenly Father has given us. The commandments in Odysseus’s story was his instructions for his men not to eat the cattle. Odysseus benefits from following the instructions, which is similar to benefitting from following the commandments. There are consequences from breaking the commandments. This is seen when Odysseus’s men eat the cattle and get killed for doing so.</p>
