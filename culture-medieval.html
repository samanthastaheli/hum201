            <h2>Medieval Christianity</h2>
            <p>The Medieval Christianity was located all over Europe. As seen in figure 1, the map of the middle ages is similar to the map of Europe today. The Holy Roman Empire is today’s Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic, Italy and part of Poland.</p>
            <img class="map" src="img/medieval/medieval-map.png" alt="medieval europe versus modern europe map" width="450px">
            <p>The Roman empire fell in 476 AD, after multiple emperors were assassinated, attacks from German tribes, plagues, lack of religion, and government power. The government of Rome had been controlled by multiple emperors, who had their own armies and separate control of part of Rome. These emperors wanted full control of Rome, so they assassinated each other which led to their government being destroyed. When there is no government structure or division within a country, that country is very susceptible to being destroyed. Medieval times begins after the fall of the Roman Empire and ends when the Renaissance begins. Thus, the Medieval period is 500 AD – 1500 AD. </p>
            <p>Christianity became the state religion of Rome in 380 AD declared by Theodosius, who was a Roman Emperor from 379-395 AD. There were three important members of the Christian church during its early years. These people were Paul, Peter, and Augustine. Paul was one of Christ 12 apostles, he was a missionary for the church. Peter was also an apostle, and he was considered the rock or pope of the church. Augustine was a Christian philosopher who disagreed with the beliefs of the Roman empire. </p>
            <img class="map" src="img/medieval/cross.png" alt="latin cross versus greek cross" width="300px">
            <p>The symbols of Christianity include the cross and the IXTHYS. There were two types of crosses, the Latin and the Greek. The Latin cross is the cross we see today, whereas the Greek cross is like a plus sign. The Latin cross is a floor plan that has been used in many churches, such as the Chartres Cathedral, also known as Norte Dome de Chartres. In Rome the cross represented crime. The IXTHYS stands for Iesous Christos, Theou, Yios, Soter. Translated means Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior. The symbol represents two arcs coming together and it extends at one end to look like a fish. The fish represents the fish that Christ fed to 5,000 people and being baptized by water.  </p>

            <p>My major, Computer Science is not directly associated with Medieval Christianity, however my major is about problem solving, design, and organization. Without those characteristics’ computer science would not exist. You cannot program or build computers without utilizing problem solving, design, and organization. At the end of the Roman Empire, they did not have any of those characteristics and they stopped functioning, comparably to software built without problem solving, design, or organization would. </p>
           
            <h2>Byzantine Empire</h2>            
            <img class="map" src="img/medieval/byzantine-map.jpg" alt="Map of the Byzantine Empire" width="400px">
            <p>The Byzantine Empire was the Eastern Roman Empire in 330 AD – 1453 AD. The empire had the longest reigning period. The capital was first named Byzantium, then changed to Constantinople under Emperor Constantine’s rule in 306-337 AD. From 284-305 AD, Emperor Diocletian split the Roman Empire into two parts to be ruled by separate emperors. He did this because the Roman Empire had gotten too large to be ruled by one person. The East side was ruled by him, while the west was ruled by Maximian and Constantius. Constantine was the son of Constantius. He took back both sides of the empire and ruled them as one. He then changed the name of the capital to Constantinople. Which served as trading port for Europe and Asia. <br>It is located between the Black and Mediterranean Sea. </p>

            <h2>Islam</h2>
            <img class="map" src="img/medieval/islamic-map.png" alt="Map of the Islamic Empire" width="400px">
            <p>Islam, also known as Muslim, is a religion that originated in Saudi Arabia. The word Islam means submission or obedience. This implies that they fulling accept God and their prophet Muhammed. Today Islam is the second largest religion in the world. Like Christianity, Islam’s also believe in the prophet Abraham, but they also believe in the prophet Muhammad. He lived from 570-632 AD. The Islam religion spread as the Islamic Empire spread. After Muhammad died, the caliphate type of government was formed where a caliph is the ruler of Islam. A caliph is a ruler who rules after Muhammad. The Rashidun caliphate expanded the Islamic borders by conquering nearby countries or empires, one of these empires was the Byzantine Empire. They ruled from 632-661 AD. They had expanded their borders, but their culture had not yet expanded with it. It wasn’t until after the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates that their culture had been adopted in other places besides Saudi Arabia.  </p>
